Clients
=======

This repo contains a list of example clients using the soup API, filed by API version. An odd minor version denotes a work-in-progress with no guarantees whatsoever. An even minor version will represent a stable endpoint that you can ship an application with without fear of sudden discontinuation of service.

In order to use the soup API you have to register a client with soup.io via http://api.soup.io/oauth_clients/ - although this interface may migrate into your users admin panel at some point in time. Please consider using a soup group where you post updates for the application URL parameter.

Also, please join http://developers.soup.io so we can keep you up to date and let you know if something changes. Also, at some point we will revoke all API credentials generated via https://api.soup.io/ouath_clients/ by users that are not part of this group.

We reserve the right to ask for some form of identification from developers at some point in the future, but for the time being, we'll just wait and see where this goes without the bureaucracy :)
